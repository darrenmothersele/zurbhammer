Start Prototype
===============

This repo can be used to start a website wireframe/prototype project using
SASS, Compass, Zurb Foundation, and Hammer.

Hammer doesn't play nice with the most recent version of Zurb Foundation or
the most recent version of Compass. Therefore I have separated them into
separate folders.

To get this working, just do `compass watch` on the root folder, then add the
`htdocs` folder to Hammer for it to build from.

## Requirements

You need to have installed SASS, Compass and Zurb Foundation (see the Zurb
documentation for details).

You'll also need a copy of Hammer for Mac, obviously.
